                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Oleksandr and I'm a Junior Frontend Developer. I am already familiar with main Web Technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git version control system.<br>
                    This page was developed during the course <a href="https://www.mastersacademy.education/frontend-for-beginners-it">'Frontend for beginners' from Masters Academy in 2023>.</a>
                    <br>
                    This is a social project from MOCG company where I got an opportunity to work with Frontend mentors and to create my own small project for the portfolio.<br>
                    You can contact me via @m0oooony and/or check out my GitHub.
